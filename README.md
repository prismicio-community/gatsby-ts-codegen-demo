# Gatsby 4Ã—4 - TypeScript code generation demo

This repository contains a basic setup to support automatic TypeScript support for your Gatsby pages' data.

[GraphQL Code Generator][gql-codegen] is used to read your source files and generate TypeScript types for each GraphQL query it finds. You can then use those types within your templates and components.

This repository is a companion to one of four talks shown during [Prismic][prismic]'s **Gatsby 4Ã—4** presentation at [Jamstack Conf 2021][jamstackconf].

## How to try this yourself

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `src/templates/blogPost.tsx` in an editor that supports TypeScript. [VS Code][vscode] works out of the box.
3. Use the `data` prop. You should see autocomplete when typing properties that are nested in `data`.

If you want to test regenerating the types:

1. Start the Gatsby development server.

   ```sh
   npm run develop
   ```

2. Edit your GraphQL query to request additional data.

3. Once bootstrapped, run GraphQL Code Generator.

   ```sh
   npm run gen
   ```

4. Once the types are regenerated, go back into `src/templates/blogPost.tsx`. You should see the properties you added as part of the `data` prop via autocomplete.

This is an easy way to ensure you are using the right data properties within your app. If you like the guidance this provides for your `data` prop, look into adopting TypeScript throughout other parts of your React app.

Have fun! ðŸ˜Š
